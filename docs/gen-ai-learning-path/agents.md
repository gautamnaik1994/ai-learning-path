# Agents

Agents are autonomous entities that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment. In the context of AI, agents can leverage large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate human-like text, enabling them to perform complex tasks such as answering questions, providing recommendations, or even engaging in conversations.

## Projects

### Supervised Agents

- Supervisor
    - Analyst
    - Researcher
    - Writer

### Hierarchical Agents

- CEO (top level)
    - Research Team Leader
        - Data Researcher
        - Market Researcher
    - Writing Team Leader
        - Technical Writer
        - Summary Writer

**Task**  
Conduct a comprehensive market research analysis and generate a detailed report.
CEO will delegate tasks to team leaders, who will further delegate to their team members. for example, the Research Team Leader will ask the Data Researcher to gather data and the Market Researcher to analyze market trends.  The Research Team Leader will then compile the findings and present them to the CEO. The CEO will then ask the Writing Team Leader to write a detailed report based on the findings. The Writing Team Leader will delegate tasks to the Technical Writer and Summary Writer. The Technical Writer will write a technical report, while the Summary Writer will summarize the findings for a broader audience.
