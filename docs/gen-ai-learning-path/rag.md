# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval systems and generative models. It allows for more accurate and contextually relevant responses by retrieving information from external sources before generating text.

## Beginner

**Goal:** Understand what RAG is, why it’s used, and be able to make a basic working example.

1. **Core Concepts**

    * What is RAG and how it differs from plain LLM prompts.

    * Retrieval vs. Generation.

    * Embeddings and vector similarity search basics.

    * Chunking & preprocessing text.

    * High-level RAG pipeline:  
        _Document → Embedding → Store → Retrieve → Generate._

2. **Hands-on Basics**

    * Install and use a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma).

    * Create embeddings with OpenAI, Hugging Face, or similar.

    * Build a **small local RAG demo**:  
        Example: “Ask questions about a PDF or Wikipedia article.”

    * Try a no-code/low-code RAG tool like LlamaIndex or LangChain templates.

## Intermediate

**Goal:** Move from toy demos to small production-ready prototypes with better accuracy.

1. **Improving Retrieval Quality**

    * Advanced chunking strategies (semantic vs. fixed-size).

    * Metadata filtering (date, category, author).

    * Hybrid search: combining keyword + vector search.

    * Handling multilingual data.

2. **Optimizing Context for the LLM**

    * Context window limits and token budgeting.

    * Summarization before passing to the LLM.

    * Prompt engineering for RAG (system prompts, few-shot examples).

3. **System Integration**

    * Creating APIs for your RAG pipeline.

    * Basic caching to save costs.

    * Connecting RAG to structured data (SQL + vector retrieval).

4. **Hands-on Project**

    * Build a **domain-specific knowledge assistant** (e.g., for finance, legal, internal docs).

    * Add filters, rerankers, and logging for retrieval results.

## Advanced

**Goal:** Handle large datasets, improve retrieval relevance, and make RAG adaptive.

1. **Scaling RAG**

    * Distributed vector search (Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone, Elasticsearch).

    * Incremental indexing & real-time updates.

    * Retrieval over billions of documents.

2. **Improving Accuracy**

    * Reranking with cross-encoders (BERT, monoT5).

    * Query rewriting for better retrieval.

    * Multi-hop retrieval for reasoning across multiple docs.

3. **RAG Variants & Hybrid Models**

    * Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) architectures.

    * Retrieval-augmented fine-tuning (RAFT).

    * Combining RAG with Agents (tools + reasoning).

4. **Monitoring & Maintenance**

    * Evaluating RAG quality (precision@k, recall@k, MRR).

    * Detecting hallucinations.

    * Feedback loops for continuous improvement.

5. **Advanced Project**

    * Deploy a **real-time, multi-source RAG** system pulling from APIs, PDFs, databases, and live web data.

    * Implement relevance feedback loops and active learning.
