# Generative AI Learning Path

This document outlines a structured learning path for mastering Generative AI, covering essential concepts, tools, and techniques. The path is divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, with each section building on the previous one.

## Pre-requisites

Before diving into Generative AI, ensure you have a understanding of the following concepts:

- Python and `pip` package management
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks

## Beginner Level

- Familiarity with machine learning concepts like training, testing, and evaluation metrics.
- Understanding of how neural networks work.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals.
- Using Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Tokenization and text preprocessing techniques.
- Understanding of vectors and similarity measures.
- Understanding of word embeddings.

### Resources

#### Free LLM APIS

- [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/)
    - Go to models page and search for free models.
    - You also get $5 free credits to use on their platform.
  
- [Groq](https://console.groq.com/home)
    - Offers some level of free usage.  

- [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
    - Offers free access to some of their Gemini models.

- If you have good GPU on you local machine, you can use [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).
    - Its good for prototyping and testing LLM code locally but do not expect high performance.

#### Courses

- [Daily Dose of Data Science](https://www.dailydoseofds.com/) I highly recommend this resource for practical AI ML skills. This is a paid resource but worth the investment.

### Projects

1. **Text Classification with Transformers**
   - Build a text classification model using Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis.
   - Try experimenting with different pre-trained models.

1. **Experiment with LLM APIs**
    - Use free LLM APIs to generate text based on prompts.
    - Compare the outputs of different models.
    - Experiment with different prompt structures to see how they affect the generated text.

## Intermediate Level

- Understanding of LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Prompt engineering techniques.
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) concepts.
- Vector databases and their applications (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant).
- Text extraction from various formats (PDF, DOCX, Image) using `pdfplumber`, `pytesseract`.
- LangChain framework.
