# Deep Learning

Follow these steps to build a strong foundation in deep learning.

## Pre-requisites

There are 2 major frameworks for deep learning: **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. Familiarity with either of these will be beneficial. But my personal preference is **PyTorch**. It can be installed easily, and it has a very good community support. You can also use **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebooks** for running your code.

Initially, you might find it difficult, but it will become easier with practice.

## Beginner

1. **Core Concepts**

    * What is deep learning and how it differs from traditional ML.

    * Neurons, weights, and biases.

    * Activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh).

    * Loss functions and optimization.

    * Introduction to overfitting and regularization.

2. **Math Prerequisites (Basics)**

    * Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, dot product).

    * Basic calculus (derivatives, gradients).

    * Probability & statistics fundamentals.

3. **Hands-on Basics**

    * Install **PyTorch**

    * Build a **simple feedforward neural network** for MNIST digit classification.

    * Visualize training curves (loss vs. accuracy).

## Resources

## Intermediate

**Goal:** Be comfortable implementing and tuning different deep learning architectures.

1. **Key Topics**

    * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images.

    * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and GRUs for sequences.

    * Transformers (basic introduction).

    * Dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation.

    * Optimizers: SGD, Adam, learning rate schedules.

2. **Model Training Practices**

    * Training/validation/test split.

    * Early stopping and checkpointing.

    * Transfer learning with pre-trained models.

3. **Hands-on Projects**

    * Image classification with CNNs on CIFAR-10.

    * Sentiment analysis on IMDB dataset using LSTMs.

    * Fine-tuning BERT for a text classification task.
